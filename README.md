# eulaw

An `R` package to access data from the `eulaw.app` API. This package provides an intuitive, easy-to-use R interface for the `eulaw.app` API. This API provides access to a variety of research-ready databases, including:

+ The Evolution of European Union Law ([EvoEU](https://github.com/jfjelstul/evoeu)) Database
+ The European Commission Internal Organization ([ECIO](https://github.com/jfjelstul/ecio)) Database
+ The European Union Infringement Procedure ([EUIP](https://github.com/jfjelstul/euip)) Database
+ The European Union State Aid ([EUSA](https://github.com/jfjelstul/eusa)) Database
+ The European Union Technical Regulations ([EUTR](https://github.com/jfjelstul/eutr)) Database
+ The European Union Member States ([EUMS](https://github.com/jfjelstul/eums)) Database

Replication materials and documentation are available in the GitHub respository for each database. 

The `eulaw.app` API, the `eulaw` package, and all of the databases were created by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D.

## Example: Getting data on the EU infringement procedure

Suppose we want directed dyad-year data on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in infringement cases since 2010. This data is available from the European Union Infringement Procedure (EUIP) Databse, which is part of the European Union Compliance Project (EUCP). 

We can easily get exactly the data we're looking for right from `R` in just a few easy steps using the `eulaw` package, which is an `R` interface for the `eulaw.app` API. This API provides access to a variety of research-ready databases, including the EUIP Database. 

### Looking up databases

First, let's double-check what datasets we have to work with. To see the databases that are available via the `eulaw.app` API, we can use the `list_databases()` function. This function doesn't have any arguments. 

```r
list_databases()
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
# # A tibble: 6 x 2
#   database_id database
#         <int> <chr>   
# 1           1 evoeu   
# 2           2 ecio    
# 3           3 euip    
# 4           4 eusa    
# 5           5 eutr    
# 6           6 eums  
```

This function requests information via the `evoeu.app` API and returns a `tibble` (see the `tidyverse`) that lists the available databases. We're going to want the `euip` database.

### Looking up datasets

Next, we need to pick the dataset in the `euip` database that has directed dyad-year data on decisions in infringement cases. To see the datasets that are available in the `euip` database, we can use the `list_datasets()` function. The function takes one argument, `database`, as given by `list_databases()`.

```r
list_datasets(database = "euip")
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
# # A tibble: 22 x 2
#    dataset_id dataset         
#         <int> <chr>           
#  1          1 cases           
#  2          2 cases_ts        
#  3          3 cases_ts_ct     
#  4          4 cases_csts_ms   
#  5          5 cases_csts_ms_ct
#  6          6 cases_csts_dp   
#  7          7 cases_csts_dp_ct
#  8          8 cases_ddy       
#  9          9 cases_ddy_ct    
# 10         10 cases_net       
# # â€¦ with 12 more rows
```

To see the whole list, we can assign the output to an object, as in `datasets <- list_datasets(database = "euip")`, and view it using `View(datasets)`. We're looking for `decisions_ddy`, which contains directed dyad-year data on decisions.

### Checking the codebook

If we don't already know we're looking for the `decisions_ddy` dataset, we can look at the codebook for the `euip` database, which contains descriptions of each dataset and variable, to see what's available and find the right dataset. We can look at the codebook for the `euip` database using the function `download_codebook()`. This function has one required argument, `database`, and one optional argument, `dataset`. It returns a `tibble`.

```r
out <- download_codebook(database = "euip")
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
View(out)
```

If we already know we're looking for the `decisions_ddy` dataset, but we still want to double-check the dataset description or the variable descriptions, we can download just the section of the `euip` codebook for the `decisions_ddy` dataset.

```r
out <- download_codebook(
  database = "euip", 
  dataset = "decisions_ddy"
)
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
View(out)
```

### Searching for data

Now that we know what database and dataset we need, and how to access the documentation, we're ready to download the data. We're specifically looking for directed dyad-year data on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under Article 258 TFEU, so we don't need to download the entire `decisions_ddy` dataset, which also includes data on referrals to the Court and decisions under Article 260 TFEU. Instead of downloading the entire dataset, we can filter the data using the API and download just what we're looking for. 

We can use the `download_data()` function to download the data. This function takes two required arguments, `database` and `dataset`, and one optional argument, `parameters`. The `parameters` argument should be a `list` that specifies values for API parameters. API parameters correspond to variables in each dataset and let you filter the data. The `download_data()` function will throw an error if we try use an invalid API parameter. 

### Looking up API parameters

We can see the API parameters that are available for the `decisions_ddy` dataset using the function `list_parameters()`. This function has two required arguments, `database` and `dataset`.

```r
list_parameters(
  database = "euip", 
  dataset = "decisions_ddy"
)
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
# # A tibble: 5 x 2
#   parameter_id parameter        
#          <int> <chr>            
# 1            1 year_min         
# 2            2 year_max         
# 3            3 department_id    
# 4            4 member_state_id  
# 5            5 decision_stage_id
```

We can see there are `5` API parameters for the `decisions_ddy` dataset. Generally, each API parameter corresponds to one variable in the dataset. There is an API parameter for all variables ending in `_id`. The one exception to this rule is the `year` variable. If a dataset includes a `year` variable, there are two API parameters, `year_min` and `year_max`. This lets you to specify a range.

### Looking up API parameter values

We want to use the `decision_stage_id` parameter and the `year_min` parameter, which will let us filter the data by decision stage and year. For the `year_min` parameter, we just need to specify a year. For the parameter `decision_stage_id`, we need to know what values to provide in order to get letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under Article 258 TFEU. We can always look up the corresponding variables, `decision_stage_id` and `decision_stage`, in the codebook (as above). But we can easily see the unique values of `decision_stage_id` using the function `list_parameter_values()`. This function has two required arguments, `database` and `parameter`. API parameters are often appear in multiple datasets within the same database and are always coded the same way across datasets, so we don't need to specify which dataset we're interested in.

```r
list_parameter_values(
  database = "euip", 
  parameter = "decision_stage_id"
)
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
# # A tibble: 6 x 2
#   value label                                
#   <int> <chr>                                
# 1     1 Letter of formal notice (Article 258)
# 2     2 Reasoned opinion (Article 258)       
# 3     3 Referral to the Court (Article 258)  
# 4     4 Letter of formal notice (Article 260)
# 5     5 Reasoned opinion (Article 260)       
# 6     6 Referral to the Court (Article 260)  
```

We can see from the output that letters of formal notice are coded `1` and reasoned opinions are coded `2`. When we specify the `parameters` argument in the `download_data()` function, we need to provide a `list` where the name of each element is a valid API parameter. If we want to specify multiple values for a parameter, we can use a vector, as in `decision_state_id = c(1, 2)`.

### Downloading data

Now that we know how to use API parameters, we can use `download_data()` to download just the data we're interested in. 

```r
out <- download_data(
  database = "euip",
  dataset = "decisions_ddy",
  parameters = list(
    year_min = 2010,
    decision_stage_id = c(1, 2)
  )
)
# Requesting data via the eulaw.app API...
# Response received...
# Observations requested: 18300
# Downloading 10000 observations every 5 seconds...
# Total estimated time: 0.08 minutes (5 seconds)
# Batch 1 of 2 complete (observations 1 to 10000 of 18300)
# Batch 2 of 2 complete (observations 10001 to 18300 of 18300)
# Your download is complete                         
#

View(out)
```

The `download_data()` function downloads the data in batches of `10000` observations. The `eulaw.app` API has a rate limit, but this function automatically manages the rate limit for us. It will download `1` batch approximately every `5` seconds. 

The function prints some useful information to the `console` while the data downloads. It tells us how many observations we have requested, how many batches it will take to download the data, and approximately how long it will take. It provides an update every time a batch is download and counts down to the next batch. The function returns a `tibble` in `tidy` format that we can manipulate with `dplyr` and `tidyr`.

And that's it! Now we have a research-ready dataset to use.
